My name is Dan Hammer, and I am first-year graduate student in the department of agricultural and resource economics at Cal. 


 the time I am done with this ordeal, I will be schooled up to my ears.  Like my academic background, this project is an exercise in economics, statistics, remote sensing, and spatial analysis.

study of the impact of short-term economic variables on clearing activity requires data with rapid turnaround.  
We are forced to accept a more limited scope in the type of clearing that we study, in order to examine the short-term impact of, say, interest rates on clearing activity.  We are only able to study relatively large-scale clearing - like the sort to make way for palm oil plantations - instead of the clearing that is associated with small-scale timber extraction.  Still, this sort of clearing activity accounts for a large proportion of deforestation in the tropics, and especially in Brazil and Indonesia.  

* Applications

These data can be used in a variety of capacities to increase our understanding of our interaction with our environment.

Preliminary results. Study the impact of protected areas on clearing rates. 

Interesting studies.  With more available data, we can intensify resarch in production theory.

The generating process of deforestation can be characterized by three dimensions: space, time, and space-time.  A quick aside, here: there is some use in thinking about this problem in terms of vector spaces to provide a context or framework to the mechanics of the subsequent classification methods.  But that is for another day.  In two dimensional space, deforestation can be identified by comparing certain characteristics of the pixel to the value of that characteristic in other, like pixels.  Consider, for example, how _green_ the pixel appears.  If the pixel is less green than similar, nearby pixels, then we may classify it differently.  Then there is the time dimension: a comparison between the way it looks now versus the way it looked three months ago, and the track it took to get between the two values.  Then, finally, we look at the interaction between space and time; the way in which the indicators of some underlying generating process (like a tractor generates cleared land) had traveled through space and time.  Given the relatively arbitrary grid laid across the landscape by MODIS to define the raster, this process can provide insight into the appropriate interpretation of pixel-level characteristics.
